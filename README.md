# 📊 Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio Repository**!  
This repo contains a collection of real-world analytics projects where I explore, clean, analyze, and visualize datasets using tools like:

- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Regex)
- 📊 **Power BI**
- 🌍 **QGIS** (for spatial data)
- 📁 **Excel** and other BI tools

Each project involves:
- Data understanding and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Insight generation
- Visual storytelling
