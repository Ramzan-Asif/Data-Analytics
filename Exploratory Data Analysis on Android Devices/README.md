# Android Devices EDA

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a dataset containing specs and prices of Android mobile phones.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Rows**: 984  
- **Columns**: 10  
- Includes: `name`, `battery`, `camera`, `display`, `memory`, `processor`, `price`, `rating`, `reviews`, `warranty`

## Objective

To analyze trends in mobile phone specifications (battery, RAM, ROM, camera, etc.) and how they influence price, ratings, and reviews.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Regular Expressions

## Data Cleaning Highlights

- Extracted RAM & ROM from `memory`
- Converted `battery`, `screen size`, and `camera` into usable numeric columns
- Parsed review counts and handled missing values
- Handled outliers and type conversions

## EDA Summary

- Price positively correlates with RAM, ROM, and screen size
- Snapdragon processors tend to cost more
- Phones with 4+ rear lenses have higher average price
- Battery size doesn’t strongly affect price
- Some high-priced phones still have low ratings (interesting!)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

This EDA taught me:
- Practical Pandas & regex for messy text data
- Data visualization for real-world mobile trends
- Structuring a project for GitHub and career portfolio
